/*
  [NOTES]
    * we can make a style for an element using it's attribute like:- src, href ...etc
      - EX: [src="source"]{} ==> this mean make a style for this element that contain this attribute value.

    * we can use ($, *, ^) before (=) in previous example 
      ** $ --> mean make this style for all elements which this attribute ends with this value
      ** * --> mean make this style for all elements which this attribute contain this value
      ** ^ --> mean make this style for all elements which this attribute start with this value

    * ( :not(element){styles} ) --> this mean make these containing styles for all element except this element
      - this element may be pseudo code like (:last-child, :first-child ...etc) 

    * if we use calc() function in sass file with variable we must
      use variable inside curly parentheses and put (#) before it
      - EX: 
            ** calc(100% - #{variable})  --> this is correct
            ** calc(100% - variable)     --> this is incorrect
